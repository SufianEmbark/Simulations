# Simulations Repository

This repository contains coursework assignments focused on simulation modeling and analysis.  
Each assignment is organized in its own folder:

- **Assignment 2** → Hospital operating theatre simulation (patients flow through preparation, operation, and recovery).  
- **Assignment 3** → Extended hospital operating theatre simulation with advanced metrics, Common Random Numbers (CRN), confidence interval comparisons, and a twisted scenario.
